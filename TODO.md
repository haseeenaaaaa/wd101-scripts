This is a list of TODO items that have been collected as feedback:

- Explain optional arguments in JS functions.
- Teach some of the basics of how _git_ works, and what _Github_ is for.
- Explain difference between JS on the browser vs on the server (NodeJS).
- Have a lesson which mentions that there are different versions of JavaSript, and that it is a language that is constantly improving.
- We may want to cover DOM in JS a little more, which could help students understand relation b/w browser and JS.
