In this video, we will look at various HTML elements available.

>Action: write a new HTML document

```html
<h1>This is a heading </h1>

```
In HTML, we use tags to wrap the text. For example, there is this tag called `<h1>`.

>Action: Write `<h1> This is a heading </h1>`

If you open the file in your browser, you can see that a heading is added to the web page.

>Acction: switch back to the editor.

If I hover over the tag, the editor gives me a nice little information about the tag. Let me click and open the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) reference.

>Action: open https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements in a new tab.


You can see that different heading tags are used. `<h1>` is a top-level heading. `<h2>` is slightly smaller. The size gets smaller with `<h3>` and `<h4>` and so on.

>Action: Write text with `h1`, `h2`, `h3` and `h4` and compare the size.


To write a normal text, we can use the `<p>` tag.

> Action: Write `<p>This is a paragraph with long content to explain something.</p>` Save and refresh the page.

These are the basic HTML tags that we can use to display texts.

HTML elements are available for almost all of the use cases. HTML comes with `<li>` and `<ul>` tags to display a list. There is an element `<a>` representing a link to another web page.

>Action: open https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element and highlight various HTML elements available.

You can see there are 100+ HTML elements available. We should make sure we use the right element for the proper usage.
