So while you're going through this course, you might encounter situations where you get stuck for some reason.

1. Maybe you have some doubt about a topic that we've just discussed.
2. Maybe you're having trouble setting up your developer environment.
3. Maybe you've having trouble executing some command or some piece of code.
4. Or maybe you have doubts about some related topic that we _haven't_ covered in this course.
5. It really could be anything.

If you have a question, please don't hesitate to ask.

One of the main advantages of being a student in this course is that you can get help from experts easily. So let's make it clear how you can get help in two parts:

First, _where_ to ask questions, and second, _how_ to ask questions.

Let's start with the first part - where to ask questions.

There are two places where you can ask questions.

> Show the user dashboard, highlighting the links mentioned below.

The first option is the _Web Development community_ within Pupilfirst School. You can access the community from your Dashboard - the link will be shown in the course card, or via the _Community_ tab up top.

> Show the _Discuss_ tab of an example target.

Or you can browse questions that were asked previously about certain lessons via the _Discuss_ tab, that takes you to the community as well.

> Show an example post in the community.

The community is structured as an online forum - it's excellent for asking longer, more detailed questions, and to receive the same as answers from coaches, or from your peers.

The second option is Pupilfirst School's Discord Server - there's a `#wd101` channel in the server that's dedicated to discussion about the WD101 course. The Discord server is meant for group chats, and it's excellent for quickly figuring out solutions for smaller issues.

> Visual: switch between community and Discord for the below:

Whether you want to use the more formal, forum, or whether you want to keep it casual, and just chat - it's up to you. Coaches will regularly monitor both of these locations to make sure that your questions are answered.

Onto the second part of the video - how to ask for help.

When asking questions, the main thing you want to make sure is to provide as much information as possible. For example, if you encountered an error while trying to run a program, you should definitely share the exact error message, maybe the command that you ran to get the error, and extra logs if there are any. Sometimes screenshots also help. If you're trying to diagnose a specific section of code, share that section of code, and describe what's going wrong. In general, there's no such thing as _too much_ information when diagnosing issues, more is almost always better.

Finally, when asking or answering questions or generally interacting with other people in the community, or in the Discord, please make sure you abide by the community guidelines - a link to the same will be provided below this video. Let's try to make sure that everbody feels welcome in asking and answering questions.

We're looking forward to seeing your queries. Bye for now!
