So while you're going through this course, you might encounter situations where you get stuck for some reason.

1. Maybe you have some doubt about a topic that we've just discussed.
2. Maybe you're having trouble setting up your developer environment.
3. Maybe you're having trouble executing some command or some piece of code.
4. Or maybe you have doubts about some related topic that we _haven't_ covered in this course.
5. It really could be anything.

If you have a question, please don't hesitate to ask.

One of the main advantages of being a student in this course is that you can get help from experts easily.

## Two parts: where & how

So let's make it clear how you can get help in two parts:

First, _where_ to ask questions, and second, _how_ to ask questions.

## Where: Web Development community

Let's start with the first part - where to ask questions.

> Show the user dashboard, highlighting the links mentioned below.

The _Web Development community_ within Pupilfirst School is the place to go if you need a coach or a teaching assistant to answer any question you have. You can access the community from your Dashboard - the link will be shown in the course card, or via the _Communities_ tab up top.

> Show the _Discuss_ tab of an example target.

You can also browse questions that were asked previously about certain lessons via the _Discuss_ tab, that takes you to the community as well.

> Show an example post in the community.

## Community - think of it like a forum

The community is structured as an online forum - it's an excellent space for asking longer, more detailed questions, and to get answers from coaches, or from your peers.

## A note about the Discord server

You might have noticed that we've sent you an invite to join a Discord Server. Discord is great for quick chats with other students who are also taking the course. But, if you have questions that you want answered by either coaches or teaching assistants, please create a post in the _Web Development_ community, not on Discord.

## How to ask questions

Onto the second part of the video - how to ask for help.

When asking questions, the main thing you want to make sure is to provide as much information as possible. We'll cover this topic in more detail in WD201 - the next course, but for now, I'll give you a few examples. If you encountered an error while trying to run a program, you should definitely share the exact error message and the command that you ran to get the error. If there are any extra logs, share those as well. Sometimes if the problem is visual in nature, screenshots also help. If you're trying to diagnose a specific section of code, share that section of code, and describe what's going wrong. In general, there's no such thing as _too much_ information when diagnosing issues, more is almost always better.

## Interacting with the community means following CoC

Finally, when asking or answering questions or generally interacting with other people in the community, or in the Discord, please make sure you abide by the community guidelines - a link to the same will be provided below this video. Let's try to make sure that everbody feels welcome in asking and answering questions.

We're looking forward to seeing your queries. Bye for now!
