> **Target title:** Introduction to Level 5

# Script

Hi! Welcome to the fifth level of Programming 101.

My name is Hari, and I'm going to focus on two aspects of programming in this level:

The first is searching.

In the earlier levels of this course, you've seen Jacob and Jasim demonstrate many concepts by typing things out in the browser and then showing you the the result. When Jasim & Jacob wrote that code, it _looks_ as though they know everything that they're writing down. For the simpler parts, yes, they do remember, but when it gets even the _slightest_ bit complicated, we need to look things up.

The reality is that you'll spend a lot of time searching for answers on the internet. For most people, including myself, Jacob, and Jasim, actually writing code to build something as complicated as website or a web service means having to look up how to write code _all the time_. This is because it's practically impossible to remember everything that's involved. A lot of our programming also involves testing, or experimenting with things using educated guesses to see if something works the way we expect it to.

I'm going to use this level to show you a _bit_ of what of all that looks like.

One thing to note: I'm going to use _Google_ to search for answers. You can use any search engine that you like - all of them should work just as well.

The second aspect that I'm going to focus on is how to _mix and match_ tools. In this level, we're going to use a browser API known as _Canvas_, that works quite a bit differently from the HTML & CSS that you've seen so far.

Towards the end of this level, we're going to use Canvas, _together_ with traditional HTML to make something a bit more complex.

We'll start using _Canvas_ in the next lesson.
