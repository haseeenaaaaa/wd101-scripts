> Concept being taught: How a "drawing" is also just data, and how manipulating that data can change the "drawing".

# Dynamic Drawings

> Author's Note: Talk about how things drawn on a canvas need not be static, and how things drawn on a canvas can _change_.
>
> Use the image drawn on the last lesson and convert some of its properties into variables. Set up a function call that _customizes_ the image with supplied properties.
>
> For example, on the stick figure, create an array of "people" objects that describes their height, and maybe the hair-style (bald, long, spiky, cap-wearing, etc.), and iterate over that to draw a group of people.
>
> Or, on the ringed planet, allow control over the number of stars, the radius of the planet, the rings, and number of rings, etc.
